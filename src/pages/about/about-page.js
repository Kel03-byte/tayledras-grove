                    <p className='background' >Something about us... well we are Neil and Paul, two guys who met about 18
                        years ago, fell in love and have been skipping through life together ever since.
                    </p>
                    <p className='background' >
                        We use to live the coperate city life with clubbing and parties but our lives just didn't feel REAL,
                        do you know waht I mean?
                        Like is this all there is? Well we weren't happy with that so went "f#%k it!"
                    </p>
                    <p className='background' >
                        We packed up and moved to the country and started a horse stud... now we wade through piles of manure,
                        but life is REAL for us.
                    </p>
                    <p className='background' >
                        Both of us have an addiction to reading (and horses!), and a range of books written by
                        Mercedes Lackey particularly inspired us. The Tayledras people featured in the books actually
                        bond with their animal "companions", take care of the land and work to continue to balance
                        the bonds between animals and humans. Their "companions" are highly intelligent, able to
                        communicate with their choosen humans and are known for their peaceful and gentle natures. It
                        felt right for this to be the inspiration and goals for our stud and breeding program - we
                        even recieved permission from the aurthor to use the name!!
                    </p>
                    <p className='background' >
                        And now - over 5 years later - we are still passionate about what we do and we know we are on our right path.
                    </p>
                    <p className='background' >
                        There's still plenty of f#%k ups and lessons to learn, all we know is that we are in it together.
