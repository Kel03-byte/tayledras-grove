                    <p>Sturdy, dependable, consistent and caring the Connemara breed has been known for generations as a safe pony for the whole family.</p>
                    <p>Already having choosen our foundations mares, we came upon a young and relatively unknown colt named Knotty, Three years old and allowed to mature at home with his herd and was the perfect fit for Tayledras Grove.</p>
                    <p>Knotty has now matured into Tye, our golden stallion.</p>
                    <p>It is always an amazing journey learning with Tye, who has proven his ancestry in breeding lovely and stunning youngsters. He is cheeky and gentle with his foals, loves talking to his ladies and showing off his moves!</p>
                    <p>Under saddle Tye loves to work and learns quickly - a trait he passes onto his foals.</p>
